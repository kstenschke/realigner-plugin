'What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly. 'Explain yourself!'
'I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice,
'because I'm not myself, you see.'
'I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.
'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely,
'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'
"It isn't," said the Caterpillar.
'Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice;
'but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, you know—and then after that into a butterfly,
 I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?'
'Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.
